Note to self from March 9, 2024.

I will become a web developer
no exceptions. All this struggle, and all the phases from Honeymmon phase,
to the depths of despair phase. Don't give up. Everybody who makes it pass 
this phase says its worth it. Now its your turn. Have fun and expand your
knowledge.

                                                        Sincerely,
                                                        Kevin Hoang
